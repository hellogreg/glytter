# glytter

This browser tool lets you view all characters for most font files (.ttf, .otf, .woff, or .woff2) on your local machine. Fonts are kept on your machine and not uploaded anywhere.

Glytter uses [fontkit](https://github.com/foliojs/fontkit) to parse font info.

The page's default typeface, [Firava](https://firava.netlify.app/), is a variable adaptation of Mozilla's Fira Sans.

This project was created by me, Greg Gibson ([hellogreg.org](http://hellogreg.org)), because I wanted a simple tool for viewing and copying character sets for fonts I'm producing or using.

Special thanks to [Adam Twardoch](http://www.twardoch.com/) and [Christian Genco](https://christian.gen.co/) for their tips on getting fontkit to work in the browser:
